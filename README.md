# RAG Project

This repository contains the code for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project utilizing the following technologies:

- **Weaviate**: A vector database for semantic search and storage of embeddings.
- **Nebula Graph**: A graph database for managing complex relationships and querying graph-based data.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a system that combines:

1. **Vector Search**: Efficiently retrieve relevant information based on embeddings stored in Weaviate.
2. **Graph Querying**: Explore and leverage complex relationships between entities using Nebula Graph.
3. **RAG Pipeline**: Integrate the capabilities of both databases to enable effective retrieval-augmented text generation.
